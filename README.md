How to build, run, and configure our code
-----------------------------------------
We created a simple Makefile which will compile our code for you. You just simply need to run `make` and the executable: `site-tester` will be produced. Make sure you create your desired `sites.txt` and `search.txt` files. 

	- The search file contains the list of strings that will be searched within the downloaded content
	- The site file contains the list of sites that should be fetched each period

To run the program, simply type: `./site-tester`.
